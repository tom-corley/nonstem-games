# Project Alpha ‚Äì Geography Game MVP  
**Team of 5** | Week 5 | Full Stack App

## üß≠ Problem Statement

Students at the Hive group of secondary schools are struggling to engage with non-STEM subjects. Traditional teaching methods are repetitive and often fail to create lasting interest or knowledge retention in areas like Geography. Our solution is a game that encourages interactive learning through map-based challenges, making non-STEM content more enjoyable.

## üí° Solution Proposal

To improve engagement in Geography lessons, we will create a browser-based educational game where students identify countries by their outline and match them to capitals. The game will:
- Be accessible via login
- Present country outlines as visual challenges
- Track player scores and progress
- Store questions and answers in a database
- Display a leaderboard to encourage friendly competition

The MVP will focus on **one game** only: identifying countries and capitals.
